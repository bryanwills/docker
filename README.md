### All of my Docker configurations and their respective configuration files.

Created 2 new branches as I am working on my Docker configs, trying to get them done properly.

branch feature/docker-backup-configs were from the original configuration and repo.
branch feature/working-docker-configs is the current branch where I am managing the working repo and will merge to main upon completion.
